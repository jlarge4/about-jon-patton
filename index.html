<h1>Slice of Life</h1>
<div>
    <p>Hi my name is Jonathan Patton I love to eat anything and go camp.</p>
    <p> My Hobbies are Gaming and Cats.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <img src="about-jon-patton.jpg"
         alt="about Jon Patton"
         class="center-image"/>
</div>
<div>
    <p>I assume Jonathan would try anything at least once.</p>

    <p>Jonathan seems like the type to have every piece of equipment needed when he goes camping.</p>

    <p>Gaming and cats seems like a mellow life.</p>

    <p>Jonathes heading for this project makes me think he loves himself some pizza.</p>
